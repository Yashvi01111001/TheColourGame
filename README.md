# color-game
Color Game provides a player with a color in RGB format e.g: RGB(0,0,0) and tiles with different colors. The tiles can be 6 or 9, depending on the number selected by the player. The player is expected to choose the tile matching the RGB color. If they do, they win. 

If the player wins:
- All the tiles change their color to the RGB. 
- A text is displayed saying they have won and a new game will start.
- A new game starts after a second with a different RGB and tiles.

If the player clicks on the wrong tile:
- The tile disappears and they get a chance to click on the remaining tiles.

Hint: use loops, high-order array methods and conditional statements.
